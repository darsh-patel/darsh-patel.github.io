                    <p> I'm a grad student in <a class="links" href="https://www.bme.jhu.edu/" target="_blank"> Johns Hopkins' Biomedical Engineering Program </a> focusing in Computational Medicine and Neuroengineering. To get a look at where I've worked and built in the past, feel free to click on my resume or LinkedIn above. 
                    <p> Currently, my primary interests lie in novel and emerging technology. I've been fortunate enough to be surrounded by and work with some super talented early-stage investors, and that's culminated in an obsession with continued innovation as it relates to software and infrastructure. Currently I'm focused on a few sectors that are at a critical juncture in their life cycles. This includes startups working on <a class="links" href="https://www.bvp.com/atlas/b2b-marketplaces/?from=feature", target="_blank">B2B marketplaces + payments</a>, <a class="links" href="https://www.usv.com/writing/2020/01/usv-and-the-climate-crisis/" target="_blank"> climate tech</a>, ML/data/cloud-native infrastructure, open source software (OSS), food tech, construction tech, fintech, and the future of insurance.</p>
                    <p> I'm also broadly interested in the future of healthcare. I've spent time with academics at the forefront of drug/gene delivery, immunoengineering, synthetic biology, and other molecular and cellular biotechnologies, and I'm interested in the continued development of novel therapeutics to tackle humanity's most puzzling biological quandaries like cancer and aging, particularly as they relate to the commoditization / increased accessibility of potentially generation-defining procedures. I think those at the Chan-Zuckerberg initiative put it best: we should aim to cure, prevent, or manage all diseases by the end of the century. Translation is being duly outpaced by academia, and shared responsibility must be taken by those in venture and scientists at the cutting edge of novel therapeutics to ensure that only the most verified and consistently replicable therapies are drawing the necessary funding.</p>
                    <p> More generally, I'm interested in civilizational immortality, and the institutions need to get there. Along these lines, I've been spending time exploring the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><i class="listheaders">Founders</i>: There are <a class="links" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Theories_of_history#:~:text=Theories%20of%20history%20are%20theories,that%20means%20for%20the%20future)." target="_blank">many theories of history</a>, but the one I most strongly subscribe to is <a class="links" href="http://samoburja.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Great-Founder-Theory-v-1.43.pdf" target="_blank">Great Founder Theory</a>, or the idea that much of history was driven forward by great founders (think: Lee Kuan Yew, Cosimo de Medici, Alexander the Great), or heroes. I'm interested in exploring the psychology and patterns in great founders making an impact at the civilizational level, as well as how we can build institutions to best support founder agency.</li>
                            <li><i class="listheaders"> Charter Cities</i>: Special Economic Zones (SEZ) have led to the birth of some of the world's most critical cities (think: Hong Kong, Dubai, Shenzhen) out of previously disadvantaged areas, and I believe <a class="links" href="https://exponentsmag.org/2019/10/08/a-beginners-guide-to-building-new-cities/?preview=true&_thumbnail_id=2282" target="_blank">charter cities are the evolution of SEZs</a>, offering a total clean slate for private-public partnerships in building infrastructure, economy, and governance from the ground up. I'm primarily interested in charter cities as a way to implement and test novel forms of governance, catalyze regional economic growth, and provide a better model for open immigration. I believe that charter cities will be a vital testbed for which the institutions of tomorrow are built, and understanding them now will set the precedence for more lofty goals (i.e. space colonization).</li>
                            <li><i class="listheaders">Knowledge and Education</i>: Preserving and passing knowledge between generations is a challenging task, and while technology has greatly facilitated this, we still face issues like <a class="links" href="https://digiday.com/media/wtf-link-rot/" target="_blank"> link rot</a> and <a class="links" href="https://hbr.org/2009/09/death-by-information-overload" target="_blank"> information overload</a>. I'm interested in solutions for information permanence (think: Arweave, IPFS) and knowledge organization (think: Roam Research, Golden, Notion). Additionally, most modern education institutions suffer from time decay. I'm interested in exploring alternative models to the traditional educational format (think: Lamba School, The Minerva Project, Sora Schools) that offer greater flexibility in applying learner interests while still preserving critical general traditions of knowledge.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <p> In addition to the above, I've been meaning to learn more about cryptocurrencies and the infrastructure necessary to scale crypto-native business models and unique alternative to fiat currencies as well as deep space manufacturing and exploration; if you're an expert or are building in these spaces, I'd love to learn from you (or please feel free to share any resources you think I'd benefit from).
                    
                    <p>More informally, I love playing/watching <a class="links" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8YEiCAPAbg" target="_blank">tennis</a>, <a class="links" href= "https://www.reddit.com/r/formuladank/" target="_blank">Formula One</a>, <a class="links" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ03bvKaoOg" target="_blank">Spikeball</a>, and <a class="links" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5YPrOroZ7Q" target="_blank">poker</a>. I'm also an amateurish foodie and enjoy exploring restaurants; here's my <a class="links" href="https://www.palette-sf.com/" target="_blank">favorite so far</a>. I'm an avid reader of sci-fi and a huge gaming and e-sports fan.</p>
