                    <p> if you have any questions or just want to chat, my inbox is always open <a class="links" href="mailto:ssreeni@berkeley.edu">here</a>.</p> -->

                    <p> I'm an student in <a class="links" href="https://met.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank"> UC Berkeley's M.E.T. Program</a> majoring in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and Business Administration. For my professional history, feel free to click on my resume or LinkedIn above. 
                    <p> Currently, my primary interests lie in crypto. Developments in cryptographic primitives and game theoretic mechanisms have led to novel economic systems like <a class="links" href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf" target="_blank">Bitcoin</a> and <a class="links" href="https://www.preethikasireddy.com/post/how-does-ethereum-work-anyway" target="_blank">Ethereum</a>. Leveraging incentive schemes made possible by these systems have led to a new open financial system, decentralized governance, unique crypto-native business models, and interesting alternatives to fiat currencies. I spend most of my time thinking about these topics, as well as the infrastructure needed to scale them.</p>
                    <p> I'm also broadly interested in novel technology. I've had the good fortune of spending time with some amazing early-stage venture funds, and I'm interested in the continued development of software applications and infrastructure, particularly as they relate to industries/sectors that are redefining existing paradigms. This includes startups working on <a class="links" href="https://li-jin.co/2019/10/22/the-passion-economy-and-the-future-of-work/", target="_blank">the passion economy</a>, open-source software (OSS), defensetech, data privacy, and others.</p>
                    <p> More generally, I'm interested in civilizational immortality, and the institutions need to get there. Along these lines, I've been spending time exploring the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><i class="listheaders">Founders</i>: There are <a class="links" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Theories_of_history#:~:text=Theories%20of%20history%20are%20theories,that%20means%20for%20the%20future)." target="_blank">many theories of history</a>, but the one I most strongly subscribe to is <a class="links" href="http://samoburja.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Great-Founder-Theory-v-1.43.pdf" target="_blank">Great Founder Theory</a>, or the idea that much of history was driven forward by great founders (think: Lee Kuan Yew, Cosimo de Medici, Alexander the Great), or heroes. I'm interested in exploring the psychology and patterns in great founders making an impact at the civilizational level, as well as how we can build institutions to best support founder agency.</li>
                            <li><i class="listheaders"> Charter Cities</i>: Special Economic Zones (SEZ) have led to the birth of some of the world's most critical cities (think: Hong Kong, Dubai, Shenzhen) out of previously disadvantaged areas, and I believe <a class="links" href="https://exponentsmag.org/2019/10/08/a-beginners-guide-to-building-new-cities/?preview=true&_thumbnail_id=2282" target="_blank">charter cities are the evolution of SEZs</a>, offering a total clean slate for private-public partnerships in building infrastructure, economy, and governance from the ground up. I'm primarily interested in charter cities as a way to implement and test novel forms of governance, catalyze regional economic growth, and provide a better model for open immigration. I believe that charter cities will be a vital testbed for which the institutions of tomorrow are built, and understanding them now will set the precedence for more lofty goals (i.e. space colonization).</li>
                            <li><i class="listheaders">Knowledge and Education</i>: Preserving and passing knowledge between generations is a challenging task, and while technology has greatly facilitated this, we still face issues like <a class="links" href="https://digiday.com/media/wtf-link-rot/" target="_blank"> link rot</a> and <a class="links" href="https://hbr.org/2009/09/death-by-information-overload" target="_blank"> information overload</a>. I'm interested in solutions for information permanence (think: Arweave, IPFS) and knowledge organization (think: Roam Research, Golden, Notion). Additionally, most modern education institutions suffer from time decay. I'm interested in exploring alternative models to the traditional educational format (think: Lamba School, The Minerva Project, Sora Schools) that offer greater flexibility in applying learner interests while still preserving critical general traditions of knowledge.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <p> In addition to the above, I've been meaning to learn more about longevity biotech and space exploration; if you have any good resources on these you'd like to share, please send them my way. I occasionally write and plan to publish some of my works on this site once they're done. 
                    
                    <p>More informally, I love playing/watching <a class="links" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8YEiCAPAbg" target="_blank">tennis</a>, <a class="links" href= "https://www.reddit.com/r/formuladank/" target="_blank">Formula One</a>, <a class="links" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ03bvKaoOg" target="_blank">Spikeball</a>, and <a class="links" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5YPrOroZ7Q" target="_blank">poker</a>. I'm also an amateurish foodie and enjoy exploring restaurants; here's my <a class="links" href="https://www.palette-sf.com/" target="_blank">favorite so far</a>. I'm an avid reader of sci-fi and a huge gaming and e-sports fan.</p>
